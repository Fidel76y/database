1. Data Dive:
I'll choose the "Netflix Shows" dataset. After downloading it, I'll import it into MySQL Workbench.

Difficulties: Depending on the format of the dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.), I might face challenges with formatting the data properly for import into MySQL.

Interesting Observation: One interesting thing I noticed about the "Netflix Shows" dataset is that it contains a variety of information such as show titles, genres, release years, and countries. This diversity of data can allow for various types of analysis, from trend analysis to geographical preferences.

2. Data Fun:
Now, let's play with some SQL queries on the "Netflix Shows" dataset.

Cool Fact 1: The most popular genres on Netflix.

sql
Copy code
SELECT Genre, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM Netflix_Shows
GROUP BY Genre
ORDER BY Count DESC
LIMIT 5;
Cool Fact 2: Average rating of Netflix shows.

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM Netflix_Shows;
3. Ask Away:
Now, let's formulate and answer some questions about the data:

Question 1: What are the top 5 countries with the highest number of Netflix shows?

sql
Copy code
SELECT Country, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM Netflix_Shows
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Count DESC
LIMIT 5;
Question 2: What are the oldest Netflix shows available?

sql
Copy code
SELECT Title, Release_Year
FROM Netflix_Shows
ORDER BY Release_Year
LIMIT 5;
What I Learned: From the first question, I learned about the countries with the highest production of Netflix shows. From the second question, I learned about the oldest shows available on Netflix, which can give insights into the platform's content history.# database
